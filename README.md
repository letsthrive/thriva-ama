# Ask me anything!

#### [Ask a question](https://github.com/letsthrive/thrive-ama/issues/new/choose)
#### [Read answered questions](https://github.com/letsthrive/thrive-ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

There are also other [labels](https://github.com/letsthrive/thrive-ama/labels) to sort the questions by.

I get a lot of questions by email but responding to an email only helps one person. This way anyone can read the answer.

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email](mailto:adeelimranr@gmail.com) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Subscribe for updates by [watching the repo](https://github.com/letsthrive/thrive-ama/subscription).

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.


#### How to get in touch
I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adeelibr) and [email](mailto:adeelimranr@gmail.com), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/letsthrive/thrive-ama/issues/new).
